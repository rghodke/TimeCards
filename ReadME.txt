Stuff that has been done:
User can create both the word and their corresponding defintions
There are failsafes in place(ex. warning for adding the same word twice)
More failsafes. (ex. if user tries adding default text, warning pops up)
The actual flashcard bit is now completed(flip,next)

Stuff to be done:
Flashcard view is lacking lots of features(hint, back, randomize)
Still buggy
